# MTG Inventory Manager

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to provide a tool for tracking Magic cards as they
are lent out and returned with the eventual intent of integrating with apps
like Slack and Discord.

## Contributing

I'm not looking for help with building this, it's really more of an exercise.
As such I will not be accepting or looking at pull requests or feature
requests.  If you want to make contributions I would recommend forking the
repository.
